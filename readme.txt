== Description ==

### What you'll get after install:
* A form input to create links to social networks, on each user profile page in admin dashboard.
* "About user" - widget to display a user card profile with avatar, name, website... and social links.
* "Social profiles" - widget to display general social links. Useful to display site connections.

### The easiest way to add social links to:
* Add links to social networks in user profiles.
* Display links to social networks in a widget, in general.
* Display user cards in profile.
* Display user info box on a single post type. You'll have to place this code somewhere: `do_action( 'zsp:author_info' );`

4. A large set of settings for user info boxes.
5. More, more, more.... You have to install it, **it's totally free**. ;)
